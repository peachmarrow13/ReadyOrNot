# RON CHEAT

A simple RON cheat I made. Most injectors should work. I personally use Xenos, but other injectors may also work.  

**Important:** Make sure you're running in DX11 and not in fullscreen. You can do this by going to the game's properties and setting your selected launch option to DirectX 11.

### Injection:
1. Open the game
2. Wait for the menu screen
3. Inject
4. Press insert to open or close the menu

> Also, don't enable/disable cheats while loading, as it will most likely crash your game.
